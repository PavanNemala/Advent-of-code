To make sure you didn't miss any, you scan the likely candidate boxes again, counting the number that have an ID containing exactly two of any letter and then separately counting those with exactly three of any letter. You can multiply those two counts together to get a rudimentary checksum and compare it to what your device predicts.\n",

    "abcdef contains no letters that appear exactly two or three times.\n",

    "abbcde contains two b, but no letter appears exactly three times.\n",
